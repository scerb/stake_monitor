# stake_monitor

---

transaction analyzer takes the addresses from data.json generated by the staking app, so you will need to use and run that first.

will only release windows exe if requested. can run on windows by installing python, then using command prompt

## staking app

python gui.py

## transaction analyzer

python tx_analyzer_app.py 

- you will need to get an etherscan api key by creating an account at etherscan.io

---

compare your staking addresses with others to find out where you rank!



linux- pull files, need to run in venv, any missing modules install as needed eg pip3 install matplotlib
then run with python3 gui.py


donate cor tokens here if you find the app useful :) 0x1788297bEceEd0b8b79eE3ccB1fc9a3Cb58408D6
